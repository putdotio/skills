description: Structure put.io frontend-owned repositories around repo-local verify and delivery contracts. Use when standardizing package repos, app repos, or SDK repos across TypeScript, Swift, Kotlin, or similar ecosystems; defining the verify command CI should call; aligning publish/deploy flows on main after verify passes; or fixing repo shape that blocks repeatable release or deployment work. Skip generic CI/CD design that does not depend on repo structure.

# Frontend Repos

Use one delivery rule: every merge to `main` should already be publishable or deployable.

Bundled references: `delivery-model.md`, `typescript.md`, `applications.md`, and `secrets.md`.
This skill owns repo shape and canonical commands, not host-specific deployment architecture.

## Workflow

1. Run the inspection commands below and capture the summary before editing.
2. Read [references/delivery-model.md](references/delivery-model.md).
3. If the repo is TypeScript, read [references/typescript.md](references/typescript.md).
4. If the repo is an application, read [references/applications.md](references/applications.md).
5. If the repo uses 1Password-backed local, live-test, build, signing, or deploy workflows, read [references/secrets.md](references/secrets.md) and standardize the local env shape.
6. Prefer one repo-local `verify` entrypoint that CI calls directly.
7. Run the repo-local `verify` command locally before changing delivery automation. If it fails, fix that command first and rerun it until it passes.
8. Configure semantic-release plugins and commit identity per the delivery-model reference when release commits are in scope.
9. Verify the publish or deploy path only after the repo-local `verify` command is stable and reproducible.
10. After publish or deploy changes, run the repo-documented artifact or app smoke check. If none exists, record that as a repo gap.

Summary shape:

```markdown
- Repo kind:
- Verify entrypoint:
- Delivery target:
- Versioning/release:
- 1Password/env needs:
- Template gaps:
```

Useful inspection commands:

```bash
rg -n '"verify"|"release"|"build"|semantic-release|deploy|publish|OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN|PUTIO_1PASSWORD|op://' \
  package.json Makefile .github README.md CONTRIBUTING.md SECURITY.md docs .env.example scripts tooling apps 2>/dev/null

test -f package.json && jq '.scripts // {}' package.json
test -f Makefile && rg -n '^[a-zA-Z0-9_.:-]+:' Makefile
test -d .github && find .github -maxdepth 3 -type f | sort
```

Concrete example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "verify": "pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build"
  }
}
```

```yaml
- name: Verify
  run: pnpm verify

- name: Release
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: pnpm release
```

App-shaped example:

```yaml
- name: Verify
  run: make verify

- name: Deploy Beta
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: make deploy-beta
```

## Guardrails

- Keep the repo-local `verify` command as the source of truth for guardrails.
- Prefer GitHub Actions for orchestration and repo-local commands as the canonical home for build, test, and deliver logic.
- Do not invent release tooling without a real repo or team standard behind it.
- GitHub-facing repos should carry a useful pull request template and issue templates when the review or triage flow benefits from them.
