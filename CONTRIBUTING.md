# Contributing

This repository stores shared agent skills for put.io development workflows.

## Setup

There is no repo-local bootstrap step beyond access to Tessl for review and publish workflows. Use `./scripts/tessl.sh` so an installed `tessl` CLI is preferred and `npx tessl` is only used as a fallback.

## Working in the repo

- shared skills live under `skills/*`
- keep top-level `SKILL.md` files concise and self-activating
- move detailed examples, doctrine, and checklists into adjacent `references/*` files
- avoid duplicating the same guidance across multiple skills when one shared source can own it

## Validation

For focused changes, review the affected skill directly:

```bash
./scripts/tessl.sh skill review --json skills/<group>/<name>
```

For broader changes, use the repository scripts:

```bash
./scripts/review-skills.sh
```

If you change publishable skill metadata such as `tile.json` or `agents/openai.yaml`, run the tile checks documented in [Overview](./README.md) and keep the picker-facing metadata aligned with the skill branding and scope.

## Pull Requests

Helpful pull requests usually include:

- the affected skill paths
- the Tessl review output or score changes when relevant
- a short note about activation, boundary, or doctrine changes

## Docs

- keep [Overview](./README.md) focused on overview, installation, and publish-facing navigation
- keep contributor workflow in this file
- keep security reporting in [Security](./SECURITY.md)
- keep agent-specific routing in [Agent guide](./AGENTS.md)
